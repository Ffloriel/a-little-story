# A little story

A little story is a website I made in May 2015.

This is an experimentation with svg and sound thanks to d3.js and the Web Audio API.
Performance was not the focus on the experiment and the code is not optimal. I updated quickly the code in 2019 but the style of 2015 still remains.
I enjoyed creating this little story and I wanted to share it with you :)

Note that there's an autoplay audio, which is no longer available on Chrome. You might need to activate autoplay for the website to hear the music and get the correct experience.

Enjoy the show :)

## The story

A little story is about a character without a name. Nameless is how you can call him.

Nameless lived in his own world, bright and full of life. He couldn't see how to live anywhere else. Nameless had a lot of love in him and he wished to share it with the world. But there's one thing he didn't realize. Something else was inside of him, it was hate. And as little as it was, it grew to take all of the space.

Nameless's world was dark, nothing was there anymore. He was alone in the dark. He felt lost in a world where he could do anything he desired. This state reminded him of what's important to him. He wanted to turn this darkness into a beautiful thing.

Nameless was frustrated, all of his previous attempts were unsuccessful, it seems that he can't do something perfectly. But Nameless is determined to do it.
