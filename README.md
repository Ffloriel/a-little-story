# A little story

A little story is a little experimentation with svg and sound. I made this in May 2015.  
Performance has been left aside and the code is not really pretty but it is a little 
experimentation that I enjoy enough to share.  

## The story

A little story is about one character that hase a lot of love inside him. Every heart 
in him are flying everywhere, he loves to demonstrate his love.
But he didn't realized that something else was in him, and it wasn't love. That thing 
in him took all the space all of a sudden. Soon, it was dark, he felt alone and lost 
in a world where it seems he could do anything he desired. He reminds himself of what 
he's important to him and turns the darkness into a beautiful thing.
